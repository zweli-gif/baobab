**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2 February 2026  
**Prepared for:** Growth Farm Executive Team

## Introduction

**Mpumi** is Growth Farm's purpose-built operating system designed to ensure the company achieves its annual goals and builds Africa's largest venture capital firm that ideates and incubates its own ideas. The name "Mpumi" reflects the app's role as a trusted companion in the Growth Farm journey, while the full "Growth Farm" branding appears throughout the application interface.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current feature set organized by navigation menu, proposed enhancements to elevate Mpumi to enterprise-grade quality, and a week-by-week development backlog through the end of February 2026.

The platform is built as a **Progressive Web Application (PWA)**, meaning it works seamlessly across desktop browsers, mobile browsers, and can be installed as a native-like app on both iOS and Android devices. Team members can add Mpumi to their home screens and launch it with a single tap, just like any other app.
