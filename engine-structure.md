# Engine Structure (from PDF Page 15)

## Growth Operations - Executive Dashboard Navigation

The Engine page should be a modal/bottom sheet with 6 navigation tiles:

1. **BD PIPELINE** - Business Development Pipeline (Kanban)
2. **VENTURES** - Venture tracking
3. **STUDIO** - Design studio projects
4. **DELIVERY** - Project delivery tracking
5. **FINANCE** - Financial management
6. **ADMIN** - Administrative functions

Each tile opens a detailed view for that operational area.
