Annual Goals Analysis - Feb 2, 2026

The Annual Goals in Settings page shows:
- Strategic Objectives: Community Growth (20%), Impact Delivery (25%), New Frontiers (20%), Stewardship (20%), Purpose & Platform (15%)
- Each objective has 5 KPIs with names like "New Members Acquired", "Member Retention Rate", etc.

However, the database query shows that goalName and strategicObjective fields are EMPTY strings!
The UI is showing data from local state, not from the database.

The issue: The Settings page is using local state for display but the database has empty goalName values.
This is why the Weekly page dropdown shows empty options - it's pulling from the database which has empty names.

Solution needed:
1. The Settings page needs to save goalName and strategicObjective to the database when edited
2. Or the database needs to be populated with the correct goal names
